# Real-Time-Face-Anonymizer
This project demonstrates a real-time face anonymization system that detects and blurs faces in a webcam feed, providing an effective solution for preserving privacy during live video capture. By combining OpenCV's video processing capabilities with MediaPipe's advanced face detection, this project ensures robust and efficient anonymization.
